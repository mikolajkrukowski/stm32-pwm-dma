Timer Handling in PWM-OUT and PWM-IN Mode Using DMA

Module: STM32 NUCLEO - F103RB

Communication with a computer via the USART interface with a circular buffer and interrupt handling.
Design and implementation of a communication protocol.
Timer handling in PWM-OUT mode using a DMA channel with a cyclic buffer and interrupts on half and full buffer completion.
Timer handling in PWM-IN mode using a DMA channel for measuring signal period and duty cycle.
Ability to generate a waveform with a defined frequency and duty cycle for single periods and receive and measure signal parameters.
